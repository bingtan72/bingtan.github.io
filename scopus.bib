abstract={We consider the bilevel variational inequality problem with a pseudomonotone operator in real Hilbert spaces and investigate two modified subgradient extragradient methods with inertial terms. Our first scheme requires the operator to be Lipschitz continuous (the Lipschitz constant does not need to be known) while the second one only requires it to be uniformly continuous. The proposed methods employ two adaptive stepsizes making them work without the prior knowledge of the Lipschitz constant of the mapping. The strong convergence properties of the iterative sequences generated by the proposed algorithms are obtained under mild conditions. Some numerical tests and applications are given to demonstrate the advantages and efficiency of the stated schemes over previously known ones. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The paper presents four modifications of the inertial forward–backward splitting method for monotone inclusion problems in the framework of real Hilbert spaces. The advantages of our iterative schemes are that the single-valued operator is Lipschitz continuous monotone rather than cocoercive and the Lipschitz constant does not require to be known. The strong convergence of the suggested approaches is obtained under some standard and mild conditions. Finally, several numerical experiments in finite- and infinite-dimensional spaces are proposed to demonstrate the advantages of our algorithms over the existing related ones. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={In this paper, we investigate an inertial Mann-like algorithm for fixed points of nonexpansive mappings in Hilbert spaces and obtain strong convergence results under some mild assumptions. Based on this, we derive a forward-backward algorithm involving Tikhonov regularization terms, which converges strongly to the solution of the monotone inclusion problem. We demonstrate the advantages of our algorithms comparing with some existing ones in the literature via split feasibility problem, variational inequality problem and signal recovery problem. © 2020 Journal of Applied and Numerical Optimization.},
